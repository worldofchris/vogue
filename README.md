# vogue
After 'Vogue' by Madonna / Shep Pettibone

```

Turbo Pascal, and Mongo
DBase and a bit of Go

Commodore Basic on the screen
Typed in from a Magazine

Grace Hopper; Harvard machine
Picture of a techno queen
Write some Flash if you care
It still runs on Adobe air

They had style, they had brace
GDB gave good trace
Pascal, Fortran, ML too
Visual Basic, we hate you [2]

LaTeX with an attitude
Functions that were very crude

Don't just stand there, let's get to it! [3]

Write some code, there's nothing to it.
Code. (Code, code, code) [1]
